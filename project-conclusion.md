# Open Data Alliance: Concluding the Project

**Description: Data Analysis**   
The outcomes of the data analysis portion of the project will be:

- a word cloud showing frequency of words, and named entities mentioned within the corpus of public records
- a visualization of LDA topics over time across the three datasets
- an "analogy machine" that displays relationships between words that frequently co-occur within the corpus

This will take two forms:

- A one-sheet document that displays public records topics
- An interactive visual component (either Tableau or something else; see **Sustainability** below)

**Description: ODA Guidebook**
In addition, I will be helping Leslie develop the following components of the other half of the project:

- Identifying valuable datasets (the one-sheet will provide some support for this)
- Thematic distillation of interview topics (we've touched on this through the design thinking/clustering projects we do weekly)
- Outreach and growth (specifically, compiling resources user-friendly for teaching yourself data analysis)

**Completion**
Steps to complete final deliverables:
1. Play around with machine learning/classification problem to see if it's viable (early week 6)
2. Clean up Jupyter Notebook/code for greater readability; add annotations where necessary (early week 6)
3. Divide notebook into a cleaning/theory notebook and a visualization notebook (early week 6)
4. Investigate different platforms for hosting analysis; if none pan out, use Tableau (throughout week 6, resolved by week 7)
5. Generate list of opportunities for further research (week 7)
6. Produce and practice presentation (week 7/week 8)

**Sustainability**
As of Week 5 of this project, Will Saunders and I are in discussion about which platform will be the most sustainable for long-term use by government employees, in terms of distributing and building on the analysis I've done, while remaining interactive for the end-user. While Tableau is frequently used in government offices, there are issues related to the cost of licensing and who will warehouse the backend data. We are going to look into using an alternative stack (possibly Flask/Heroku/Jupyter) or (GitHub Pages/Vega) and if there is a straightforward way to try out a different hosting platform. I have experience with the former so I am leaning toward that, but if it fails we'll default to Tableau.
