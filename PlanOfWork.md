# Open Data Alliance: Public Records Analysis, Governance, and Standards

**Description**   
My sponsors for the project are David Doyle and Will Saunders. David is from the City of Seattle, and Will is from the State of Washington. The project I would hope to undertake is to collect, collate, and share data about public records requests (PRRs), in order to better serve the citizenry.

My partner on this project is Leslie Denning, who will be working in parallel with me to complete the 'charter' portion of the project, as well as scoping and consolidating this outline.

**Goals**     
The goal of the project is to understand the kinds of records requests that state/city/country government offices get, and with what frequency. If we know that there is a broad interest in a topic (or series of topics), we can productively and preemptively make disclosures for our citizens. This saves time; citizens won't have to submit as many requests for data. Simply, as bullet points, this project is about:

- Understanding sources of data, and producing governance and standards around data
- Analysis of trends in the data sources

**Deliverables**    
Related to the goals above, this project will produce the following line items as output:

- Visualizations of trends in the data, in order to understand the 'aboutness' of PRRs across Western Washington
- A charter, entailing documentation related to the sources of data and suggested best practices for future members of the Open Data Alliance

*Interim*     
- The interim deliverables for the project will include a collated series of interviews with stakeholders; a blog post detailing the outcomes of these interviews and how they will inform our analyses; and cursory visual and numerical analysis of curated data sources.

*End of project*
- The final deliverable includes a visualization of trends in the data, such that a government office or stakeholder can connect an API or database and have a "rolled up" representation of the information their office collects regarding PRRs.

It will also include a body of standards and guidelines for the governance of open government data, in the form of a charter.

The charter will be influenced by the outcome of the work with data--we can't make recommendations about what the data should look like without understanding the travails and problems that come from working with disparate data sources.

**Plan for Sustainability**       
Managing deliverables will be based on understanding the possible data sources that the State and City have access to. After dialogue with intra-governmental stakeholders and a survey of the number and complexity of the data sources, we can start cleaning, standardizing, and analyzing data.

The idea underpinning this project is that the things we produce will be able to be used by the City of Seattle as well as other agencies as they standardize and scale their analyses of PRRs. At the end of the project, I will submit well-documented code and a standards document, to ensure that people that might continue the project can pick up where I left off.

**Milestones**    
In broad strokes, these are the different things we intend to undertake as part of this project.

Weeks 1-2: Set up interviews; collect datasets; conduct interviews; project planning and logistics
Weeks 3-4: Conduct interviews; clean data; conduct cursory analyses; write blog post
Weeks 5-6: Start work on reproducible visualizations; review interview data--understand and articulate needs of new ODA signatories
Weeks 7-8: Draft of final projects (visualizations/backend code/charter); final blog post; structure/goals for next ODA meeting

**TODOs**
Reposition and consolidate project scope during weeks 2-3
Add line-item `Issues` that support the completion of milestones
