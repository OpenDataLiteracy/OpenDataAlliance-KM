# Thematic Clustering Sessions
After completing a round of interviews each week, my fellow intern and I took about an hour to structure our thoughts. We sought to write down the most salient ideas across 5-6 interviews and search for emergent common themes. Many folks call these affinity diagrams, but we took to calling them **thematic clustering sessions**. We structured them as a sort of game.

These are the rules for a round:
 - 2 minutes, to write down notes from the interview on a series of post-its
 - About 30sec to 1min to explain your note/theme and place it on the surface
 - About 30sec to 1min for your partner explain your note/theme and place it on the surface
 - Repeat until there are no more post-its left
 
 Then, as rounds are completed:
 - Move post-its that are similar into groups, explaining relationships when moving
 - When groups are relatively solid, develop category labels/names
