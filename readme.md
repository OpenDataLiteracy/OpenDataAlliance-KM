Description of Potential Project from Will Saunders

April 13, 2018

Basically we are contemplating two possible project elements that could be undertaken in parallel:

1.Staffing/organizing a regional open data alliance, including a summit (or maybe just meetings), analyzing our respective open data catalogs for common (or conflicting) data, a recommended “getting started” list of datasets for new cities to publish (a la “Proactive Disclosure” in BC)

2.Pooling public records request data – under new law from last year every city and agency in WA will have to start keeping open records of their public records requests. The NW Open Data consortium plans to pool and publish the trends and basic data about PRR’s from member jurisdictions. We would be looking for student support to synthesize the data and automate publication.
 
Seattle would likely be the best host, but the state, and City of Olympia would also like to work with the student or students.
 
The issues that each intern should complete are as follows

- Read the `Internship Agreement` and agree to the terms. (You agree to the terms by repsonding to the issue) 
- Read the `Plan of Work` document and begin working with your mentor to complete this document. The document must be complete 2 weeks in advance of beginning your internship. 
- List dates of availability (including their start date and any known (or potential) dates of conflict)
