    "At the onset of this project, we obtained data extracts from a number of institutions and municipalities of different sizes, with the intention of collating them into one repository for analysis. Upon receipt, there were a handful of things that we realized, which dramatically reduced the kind of analysis that we could perform on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Government bodies have different reporting standards for metadata.** I believe this is related to the platform/infrastructure the institution is using to fulfill and manage requests. The fields of interest, as well as the types of data accessible within those fields, are often so distinct that they cannot be combined in a straightforward way. For example, some municipalities have tons of great metadata reporting, especially around the estimated amount of time and actual amount of time that it took to fulfill a request.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inputs are not standardized.** Both people and institutions submit public records requests, which means that there are differing degrees of detail, complexity, and formatting. Some people submit a few words or a case number in their request, while others copy-paste several spreadsheet columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **There is personal identifying information everywhere.** The more I dug into records requests, the more I saw people signing their requests with their name, address, and contact information. It's hard to strip out this information with software, especially because requests ask for information on a particular person or named entity. This is problematic for open data projects, namely because \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **All data are equal, but some data are more equal than others.** This project charts out some methods that can be used across departments that have different numbers of records requests, but there's little we can do (and little inference we can provide) for a department that has but one solitary request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confluence of all of these factors effectively means that it's hard to look for trends. *Not great.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It's really important to clean and harmonize the data as best we can. As such, we ended up throwing away most of the data that we had and working with a much smaller subset. After importing the data into a pandas dataframe, we kept:\n",

    "## Future Metadata Standards\n",

    "- Unique Identifier for Record/Case (hash)\n",
    "- Creation Date (datetime object)\n",

    "Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a tool for finding implicit relationships in a large body of text. The algorithm produces topics, which essentially are groupings of words that we--statistically speaking--expect to have some degree of association (represented through co-occurrence within a document). As such, topics are not explicitly related through semantics or knowledge content--it is through later inference that we understand the emergent higher-level categories.\n",

It could be the case that a subset of these words are explicitly (and exclusively) related to a particular category, while others occur within each category with about the same frequency distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LDA, we are able to categorize all of these words into groups that make sense. The computer groups 'China', 'bamboo', 'black', 'white', and 'cute' together, and our human inference suggests *'panda'*. In contrast, if we see 'Croatia', 'spotted', 'black', 'white', and 'cute', in the computer output, we think *'dalmatian'*. It's okay that the different topics overlap--as in human languages, semantic meaning is often distributed across different words.\n",

Each word contained within that vector space is encoded as a vector, comprised of a 1 where the word is and 0's everywhere else). There is a hidden filter layer which compresses the size of this vector while minimizing information loss, as smaller vectors are less computationally complex to compare. Finally, the word vectors are all positioned in the vector space relative to each other, with more similar words clustered together."
